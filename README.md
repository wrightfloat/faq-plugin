# faqizer
A wordpress plugin.

My main goal with this plugin is for users to be able to setup a basic faq page, and not have to pay to use basic features.

The main basic features i'm reffering too are:

1. Adding a FAQ widget to display most popular posts.
2. Setup faq Categories with sidebar widget. 
3. Search the faqs. 

The current state of this plugin is still in development, so I would not use it at the moment.

I will be adding new features in my spare time.
