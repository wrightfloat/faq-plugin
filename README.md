# faqizer
A wordpress plugin.

My main goal with this plugin is for users to be able to setup a basic faq page, and not have to pay to use basic features that
can be implemented by a custom post type and adding a few settings.

The main things i'm reffering to:
1. Adding a FAQ widget to display most popular posts.
2. Setup faq Categories with sidebar widget. 
3. Search the faqs. 

The current state of this plugin is still in development, so I would not use it at the moment.

I will be working on it daily an adding features, in my spare time.
